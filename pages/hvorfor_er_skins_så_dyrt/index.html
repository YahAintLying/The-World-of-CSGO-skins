            <h2>CSGO har et veldig stor samfunn for skinsene i spillet</h2>
            <h3>Hva definerer prisen?</h3>
            <p>
                Ever since skins were introduced in the game, they began to get
                a lot of attention due to the loyal and passionate fanbase. With
                more players joining in the game and buying these skins, Valve
                knew it was the best thing that could happen to them and so they
                have been regularly introducing new skins into the game. These
                skins come with a case but most of the skins are usually very
                cheap with a few exceptions, of course. So, the chance of
                getting an expensive skin is pretty low and that is what defines
                the price of the skin, it’s a rarity! Now we already know that
                opening a case requires you to buy a key for a couple of bucks,
                but according to an analyst the chance of getting a rare item
                from the case is as low as 1-2%, which is extremely low and for
                someone like me who doesn’t even trust his own luck, I wouldn’t
                wanna take my chances even if it’s 50-50. Now, for a probability
                as low as 1%, one would have to open more than 100 crates or so
                to get a rare item, but then again, if you are LUCKY! So, if you
                decide to open up a ton of crates to get a rare item, it’d
                probably set you back 250 bucks or so, easily. Until you are
                smart enough to gather up a few bucks and buy a rare skin from a
                trusted marketplace like Eldorado, which would be way cheaper.
                And the same goes for knives in the game, the fact that they are
                extremely rare to be dropped in a crate is what makes them so
                expensive! It all comes down to an item’s rarity, the rarer the
                item is the more expensive it is going to be.
